**Founder Mode, hackers, and being bored by tech**
**Ian Betteridge**

This post critiques the "cult of the founder" in Silicon Valley, arguing that Paul Graham's views on management are flawed due to his lack of experience in large companies.  The author contrasts the ideals of hackers with the current focus on "hero founders" who prioritize hype cycles and revenue growth over genuine innovation and ethical considerations.

He suggests that the resulting one-dimensionality of tech coverage and personalities has led to a sense of boredom and dismay among tech commentators, who long for a return to the hacker ethos and a less hype-driven environment.

The author connects this with the shift from a diverse tech landscape to one dominated by a few powerful figures.


**Summary of the discussion:**

* **Criticism of Graham's "Founder Mode":** Several commenters criticize Paul Graham's views on management and leadership, arguing that his lack of experience in large companies makes his perspective limited and potentially harmful.  Some acknowledge a kernel of truth in his observations about challenges in scaling startups but find his overall thesis flawed and oversimplified.  Others note that the original talk which inspired the "founder mode" post was reportedly superior to the written piece.

* **Generational Shift and Boredom:** The discussion acknowledges a generational shift in the tech industry, with older figures dominating the conversation while younger people find their perspectives outdated or uninspiring. This contributes to the sense of boredom described in the original post.

* **The Decline of the Hacker Ethos:** Many commenters lament the decline of the hacker ethos, which they see as being replaced by a focus on profit maximization and hype cycles. They miss the emphasis on creativity, innovation, and open-source collaboration that characterized earlier eras of the industry.

* **Systemic Issues in Hiring and Promotion:** Some commenters argue that the problems discussed in the post are not solely attributable to founders but are also rooted in systemic issues within the tech industry.  They point to misaligned incentives, a focus on metrics and promotion, and the prevalence of "professional fakers" in leadership positions.

* **The Role of Venture Capital and Economic Factors:** The role of venture capital and the broader economic environment is discussed as a major contributor to the current state of the industry.  The pressure to achieve hyper-growth and the influence of investors on company strategy are criticized.

* **Positive Developments in Tech:**  Despite the negativity, some commenters highlight promising developments in areas like self-driving cars, robotics, electric vehicles, and medical technology.

* **The Need for a Shift in Voices:** There's a general agreement that a shift in voices within tech is needed, with a call for more domain experts and less focus on hype-driven narratives.
