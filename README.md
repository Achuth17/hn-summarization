## Writing Composable SQL using Knex and Pipelines

## This post discusses the challenges of integrating SQL with host languages like JavaScript and Python, highlighting the impedance mismatch between SQL's declarative nature and the host languages' paradigms.  It introduces Knex.js, a query builder that addresses this issue by allowing programmatic query construction without string concatenation. The post demonstrates how to use Knex to build queries for a simple discussion forum and further enhances composability through the implementation of a pipeline function, enabling the sequential execution of query modifier functions. This approach eliminates the need for explicit query object passing, improves maintainability, and simplifies testing.

## Summary of the discussion:

* **larodi:** Questions the common acceptance of mixing HTML/JS in React and regex in other contexts while criticizing the lack of widespread adoption of properly bound SQL in ORMs.  Highlights the value of falling back to raw SQL for performance reasons, even with advanced schema systems.
* **anonzzzies:** Explains their use of Knex for its dynamic capabilities, particularly in TypeScript projects where code generation for dynamic queries is slower.  Emphasizes the benefit of immediate feedback during dynamic query building.
* **bearjaws:** Shares positive experiences using Knex before TypeScript's prevalence, contrasting it favorably with ORMs like Bookshelf and highlighting its usefulness for migrations and building a query-builder service. Mentions a custom extension for performance monitoring.
* **mythz:** Announces a newly released type-safe, SQL-like parameterized TypeScript/JS ORM (LitDB) for multiple databases, emphasizing its type safety and composability features.
* **h1fra:** Recommends Kysely as an alternative to Knex and Prisma, praising its typing, tooling, and feature completeness.
* **natpalmer1776:** Expresses humorous disbelief regarding the use of Knex, possibly due to unfamiliarity or a perceived limitation.
